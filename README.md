# Experiment to test CDK ssm behaviour

1. run `./deploy-path-change-test.sh` to test behaviour when an ssm path changes in a stack.
2. run `./deploy-value-change-test.sh` to test behaviour when an ssm value changes in a stack.
3. `./destroy.sh` cleans everything up

It is a good idea to run `./destroy.sh` between each of the tests above.
